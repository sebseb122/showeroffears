# Shower of Fears

To download the full instructions and code for the "Shower of Fears" project, you must first follow the instructions of "Shower of Fears - Part 1.pdf" to setup a Thermal Printer and run the code "FearPart1.ino" which will print out a bitmap of a QR code that will take you to a dropbox link of all the instrudtions for the full "Shower of Fears" project.

"Shower of Fears - Part 1.pdf" will take you through the process of setting up a thermal printer which will be important for setting up the final as you will need to set up 3 and have them working together in one .ino file.
